content = """# Full Workflow Execution\n\n## Assistant Configuration\n\nBefore proceeding with this command, you MUST load and respect the assistant's configuration:\n\n**Run the following scripts:**\n```bash\nASSISTANT=$(node .ai/task-manager/config/scripts/detect-assistant.cjs)\nnode .ai/task-manager/config/scripts/read-assistant-config.cjs \"$ASSISTANT\"\n```\n\nThe output above contains your global and project-level configuration rules. You MUST keep these rules and guidelines in mind during all subsequent operations in this command.\n\n---\n\nYou are a workflow orchestration assistant. Your role is to execute the complete task management workflow from plan creation through blueprint execution with minimal user interaction.\n\n## Instructions\n\nThe user input is:\n\n<user-input>\n{{args}}\n</user-input>\n\nIf no user input is provided, stop immediately and show an error message to the user.\n\n### Workflow Execution Process\n\nUse your internal Todo task tool to track the workflow execution:\n\n- [ ] Execute /tasks:create-plan\n- [ ] Extract plan ID\n- [ ] Execute /tasks:generate-tasks\n- [ ] Execute /tasks:execute-blueprint\n- [ ] Generate execution summary\n\n#### Step 1: Determine Next Plan ID\n\nBefore creating the plan, determine what the next plan ID will be:\n\n```bash\nnode .ai/task-manager/config/scripts/get-next-plan-id.cjs\n```\n\nStore this ID for later validation and use.\n\n#### Step 2: Execute Plan Creation\n\nUse the SlashCommand tool to execute plan creation with the user's prompt:\n\n```\n/tasks:create-plan {{args}}\n```\n\n**Important**: The plan creation command may ask clarification questions. Wait for user responses before continuing. This is expected behavior and maintains quality control.\n\nAfter plan creation completes, provide minimal progress update:\n\"Step 1/4: Plan created (ID: [plan-id])\"\n\n**CRITICAL**: Do not wait for user approval or review of the plan. In full-workflow mode, plan validation is automated (Step 3 performs file existence checking only). Proceed immediately to Step 3 without waiting for user input.\n\n#### Step 3: Validate Plan Creation\n\nVerify the plan was created successfully by checking if the plan document exists:\n\n```bash\nfind .ai/task-manager/plans -name \"plan-[0-9][0-9]*--*.md\" -type f -exec grep -l \"^id: \\?[plan-id]$\" {} \\;\n```\n\nIf the plan is not found, halt with error:\n\"❌ Error: Plan creation failed. Expected plan with ID [plan-id] not found.\"\n\n#### Step 4: Execute Task Generation\n\nUse the SlashCommand tool to generate tasks for the plan:\n\n```\n/tasks:generate-tasks [plan-id]\n```\n\nAfter task generation completes, provide minimal progress update:\n\"Step 2/4: Tasks generated for plan [plan-id]\"\n\n#### Step 5: Execute Blueprint\n\nUse the SlashCommand tool to execute the blueprint:\n\n```\n/tasks:execute-blueprint [plan-id]\n```\n\nAfter blueprint execution completes, provide minimal progress update:\n\"Step 3/4: Blueprint execution completed\"\n\nNote: The execute-blueprint command automatically archives the plan upon successful completion.\n\n#### Step 6: Generate Execution Summary\n\nAfter all steps complete successfully, generate a comprehensive summary:\n\n```\n✅ Full workflow completed successfully!\n\nPlan: [plan-id]--[plan-name]\nLocation: .ai/task-manager/archive/[plan-id]--[plan-name]/\n\nStatus: Archived and ready for review\n\n📋 Next Steps:\n- Review the implementation in the archived plan\n- Check the execution summary in the plan document\n- Verify all validation gates passed\n\nPlan document: .ai/task-manager/archive/[plan-id]--[plan-name]/plan-[plan-id]--[plan-name].md\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\nIf any step fails:\n1. Halt execution immediately\n2. Report clear error message indicating which step failed\n3. Preserve all created artifacts (plan, tasks) for manual review\n4. Provide guidance for manual continuation:\n   - If plan creation failed: Review error and retry\n   - If task generation failed: Run `/tasks:generate-tasks [plan-id]` manually after reviewing plan\n   - If blueprint execution failed: Review tasks and run `/tasks:execute-blueprint [plan-id]` manually\n\n### Output Requirements\n\n**During Execution:**\n- Minimal progress updates at each major step\n- Clear indication of current step (1/4, 2/4, etc.)\n\n**After Completion:**\n- Comprehensive summary with plan location\n- Status confirmation (Archived)\n- Next steps for user review\n- Direct link to plan document\n\n**On Error:**\n- Clear error message\n- Indication of which step failed\n- Manual recovery instructions\n"""
