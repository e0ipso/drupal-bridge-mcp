# POST_PLAN Hook

This hook provides validation and update procedures to execute after plan creation, ensuring
comprehensive context analysis and proper plan document structuring with dependency visualization.

Ensure these are completed:

- [ ] There is no scope creep: the plan implements what the user requested
- [ ] The plan is complete: the AI gathered all the necessary information from the user to ensure
      plan completeness
- [ ] There are no tasks or implementation details: this plan is like a PRD (Product Requirements
      Document)
- [ ] The plan details the relevant files and systems already existing
