## Objective

Create comprehensive Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting critical testing and quality
assurance decisions for the MCP server project.

## Skills Required

- **documentation**: Create structured ADR documentation following established format and
  conventions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ADR-021: Testing Framework Selection and Integration Strategy created
- [ ] ADR-022: End-to-End Testing Approach for MCP Protocol and Drupal Integration created
- [ ] ADR-023: Performance Testing and Monitoring Strategy created
- [ ] ADR-024: Security Testing and Vulnerability Assessment Framework created
- [ ] All ADRs follow established format and numbering sequence
- [ ] ADRs placed in `@architecture/adr/` directory
- [ ] ADRs provide clear rationale for testing technology and strategy decisions

## Technical Requirements

- Follow existing ADR format and structure
- Document decision context, options considered, and rationale
- Include consequences and trade-offs of testing approach decisions
- Reference specific testing technologies and frameworks chosen
- Provide guidance for future testing strategy evolution
- Maintain consistency with existing architectural documentation

## Input Dependencies

- Testing strategy decisions from plan implementation
- Existing ADR format and numbering sequence
- Architecture documentation structure

## Output Artifacts

- ADR-021: Testing Framework Selection and Integration Strategy
- ADR-022: End-to-End Testing Approach for MCP Protocol and Drupal Integration
- ADR-023: Performance Testing and Monitoring Strategy
- ADR-024: Security Testing and Vulnerability Assessment Framework

## Implementation Notes

These ADRs should document the key decisions made during testing strategy implementation, providing
future maintainers with context and rationale for the chosen approach. Focus on capturing the "why"
behind testing technology selections and strategy decisions.

Each ADR should address:

- Context and problem statement
- Decision drivers and constraints
- Options considered
- Chosen solution and rationale
- Consequences and trade-offs
- Implementation guidance
